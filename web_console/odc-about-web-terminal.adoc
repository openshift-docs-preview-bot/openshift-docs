<Confirm with Gaja and Abhi on cli tools as well as project context>This terminal instance is pre-installed with common CLI tools for interacting with the cluster, such as `oc`, `kubectl`,`odo`, `kn`, `tkn`, `helm`, `kubens`, and `kubectx`.
It has the context of the project you are working on and automatically logs you in using your credentials.

You must install the *Web Terminal* Operator to use the web terminal.
