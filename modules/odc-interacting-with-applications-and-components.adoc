= Interacting with applications and components

The *Topology view* in the *Developer* perspective of the web console provides the following options to interact with applications and components:

* Use the *Shortcuts* menu on the upper-right of the screen to navigate components in the *Topology view*.
* Click *Open URL* (image:odc_open_url.png[title="Application Link"]) to see your application exposed by the route on a public URL.
* Click *Edit Source code* to access your source code and modify it.
+
[NOTE]
====
This feature is available only when you create applications using the *From Git*, *From Catalog*, and the *From Dockerfile* options.
====
+
* Hover your cursor over the lower left icon on the Pod to see the name of the latest build and its status. The status of the application build is indicated as *New* (image:odc_build_new.png[title="New Build"]), *Pending* (image:odc_build_pending.png[title="Pending Build"]), *Running* (image:odc_build_running.png[title="Running Build"]), *Completed* (image:odc_build_completed.png[title="Completed Build"]), *Failed* (image:odc_build_failed.png[title="Failed Build"]), and *Canceled* (image:odc_build_canceled.png[title="Canceled Build"]).
* The status or phase of the pod is indicated by different colors and tooltips as *Running* (image:odc_pod_running.png[title="Pod Running"]), *Not Ready* (image:odc_pod_not_ready.png[title="Pod Not Ready"]), *Warning*(image:odc_pod_warning.png[title="Pod Warning"]), *Failed*(image:odc_pod_failed.png[title="Pod Failed"]), *Pending*(image:odc_pod_pending.png[title="Pod Pending"]), *Succeeded*(image:odc_pod_succeeded.png[title="Pod Succeeded"]), *Terminating*(image:odc_pod_terminating.png[title="Pod Terminating"]), or *Unknown*(image:odc_pod_unknown.png[title="Pod Unknown"]).
For more information about pod status, see the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-phase[Kubernetes documentation].
* After you create an application and an image is deployed, the status is shown as *Pending*. After the application is built, it is displayed as *Running*.

The application resource name is appended with indicators for the different types of resource objects as follows:
+
** *CJ*: `CronJob`
** *D*: `Deployment`
** *DC*: `DeploymentConfig`
** *DS*: `DaemonSet`
** *J*: `Job`
** *P*: `Pod`
** *SS*: `StatefulSet`
** image:odc_serverless_app.png[title="Serverless Application"] (Knative): A serverless application
+
[NOTE]
====
Serverless applications take some time to load and display on the *Topology view*. When you create a serverless application, it first creates a service resource and then a revision. After that, it is deployed and displayed on the *Topology view*. If it is the only workload, you might be redirected to the *Add* page. After the revision is deployed, the serverless application is displayed on the *Topology view*.
