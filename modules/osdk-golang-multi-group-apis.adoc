= About multi-group APIs

Before creating an API and controller, consider whether your Operator requires multiple API groups. This tutorial covers the default case of a single group API, but to change the layout of your project to support multi-group APIs, you can run the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ operator-sdk edit --multigroup=true
----

This command updates the `PROJECT` file, which should look like the following:

[source,yaml]
----
domain: example.com
layout: go.kubebuilder.io/v3
multigroup: true
...
----

For multi-group projects, the API Go type files are created under `apis/<group>/<version>/`, and the controllers are created under `controllers/<group>/`. The Dockerfile is then updated accordingly.
