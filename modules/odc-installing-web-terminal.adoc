= Installing the web terminal

You can install the web terminal using the *Web Terminal* Operator listed in the OpenShift Container Platform OperatorHub. When you install the *Web Terminal*  Operator, the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) required for the command line configuration, such as the `DevWorkspace` CRD, are automatically installed along with the Operator. The OpenShift Console creates the required resources when you open the web terminal.

.Prerequisites
* Access to an OpenShift Container Platform cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions.

.Procedure
. In the *Administrator* perspective of the web console, navigate to *Operators â†’ OperatorHub*.
. Use the *Filter by keyword* box to search for the `Web Terminal` Operator in the catalog. Click the *Web Terminal* tile.
. Read the brief description about the Operator on the *Web Terminal*  page, and click *Install*.
. On the *Install Operator* page, retain the default values for all fields.
. The *All namespaces on the cluster (default)* for the installation mode installs the Operator in the default `openshift-operators` namespace, which enables the Operator to watch and be made available to all namespaces in the cluster.
. The *Automatic* approval strategy ensures that the future upgrades to the Operator are handled automatically by the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).
. The *Update Channel* enables installation of the latest release of the *Web Terminal* Operator.
. Click *Install*, and then click the *View operator* <test this part for the UI names> in the *Installed Operators* page to see the Operator listed on the *Installed Operators* page.
. After the Operator is installed, refresh your page to see the command line terminal icon on the upper right of the console.
