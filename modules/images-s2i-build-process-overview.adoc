= Source-to-image build process overview

Source-to-image (S2I) produces ready-to-run images by injecting source code into a container and letting the container prepare that source code to be run. It performs the following steps:

. Starts a container from the builder image.
. Downloads the application source.
. Streams the scripts and application sources into the builder image container.
. Runs the `assemble` script from the builder image.
. Saves the final image.
