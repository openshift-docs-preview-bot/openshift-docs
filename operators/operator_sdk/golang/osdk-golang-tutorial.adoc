toc::[]

This tutorial outlines Go programming language support in the Operator SDK and walks Operator authors through building an example Go-based Operator for Memcached, a distributed key-value store, and managing its lifecycle. The tutorial goes into greater detail than the quickstart.

This is accomplished using two centerpieces of the Operator Framework: Operator SDK (the `operator-sdk` CLI tool and `controller-runtime` library API) and Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).
