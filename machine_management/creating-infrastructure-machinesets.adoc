toc::[]

You can create a machine set to host only infrastructure components. You apply specific Kubernetes labels to these machines and then update the infrastructure components to run on only those machines. These infrastructure nodes are not counted toward the total number of subscriptions that are required to run the environment.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Unlike earlier versions of {product-title}, you cannot move the infrastructure components to the master machines. To move the components, you must create a new machine set.

== Creating infrastructure machine sets for production environments

In a production deployment, deploy at least three machine sets to hold infrastructure components. Both the logging aggregation solution and the service mesh deploy Elasticsearch, and Elasticsearch requires three instances that are installed on different nodes. For high availability, deploy these nodes to different availability zones. Since you need different machine sets for each availability zone, create at least three machine sets.

Use the sample machine set for your cloud.
