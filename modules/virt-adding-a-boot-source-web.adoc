= Adding a boot source for a virtual machine template

A boot source can be configured for any virtual machine template that you want to use for creating virtual machines or custom templates. When  virtual machine templates are configured with a boot source, they are labeled *Available* in the *Templates* tab.

.Procedure

. In the {VirtProductName} console, click *Workloads* -> *Virtualization* from the side menu.

. Click the *Templates* tab.

. Identify the virtual machine template for which you want to configure a boot source. Click *Add source*.

. In the *Add boot source to template* window, click *Select boot source*. Select a method for creating a persistent volume claim (PVC): *Upload local file*, *Import via URL*, *Clone existing PVC*, or *Import via Registry*.

.. Click *Mount this as a CD-ROM boot source*.

. Click *Save and upload* if you uploaded a local file. Click *Save and import* if you imported content from a URL or the registry. Click *Save and clone* if you cloned an existing PVC.

Your custom virtual machine template with a boot source is listed in the *Templates* tab, and you can create virtual machines by using this template.
