= Creating a migration plan in the {mtc-short} web console

You can create a migration plan in the  for the {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) web console.

.Prerequisites

* The source and target clusters must have network access to each other and to the replication repository.
* If you use snapshots to copy data, the source and target clusters must run on the same cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and be located in the same region.

.Procedure

. In the {mtc-short} web console, click *Migration plans*.
. Click *Add migration plan* to launch the Migration Plan wizard.
. In the *General* screen, enter the *Plan name*.
. Select a source cluster, a target cluster, and a replication repository and then click *Next*.
. In the *Namespaces* screen, select the projects to be migrated and then click *Next*.
. In the *Persistent volumes* screen, click a *Migration type* for each PV:
* The *Copy* option copies the data from the PV of a source cluster to the replication repository and then restores it on a newly created PV, with similar characteristics, in the target cluster.
+
If you specified a route to an image registry when you added the source cluster to the web console, you can migrate images directly from the source cluster to the target cluster.
* The *Move* option unmounts a remote volume, for example, NFS, from the source cluster, creates a PV resource on the target cluster pointing to the remote volume, and then mounts the remote volume on the target cluster. Applications running on the target cluster use the same remote volume that the source cluster was using. The remote volume must be accessible to the source and target clusters.
. Click *Next*.
. In the *Copy options* screen, click a *Copy method* for each PV:
* The *Snapshot copy* option backs up and restores the disk using the cloud provider's snapshot functionality. Copying snapshots is faster than copying the file system.
+
[NOTE]
====
The storage and clusters must be in the same region and the storage classes must be compatible.
====
* The *Filesystem copy* option backs up the files on the source cluster and restores them on the target cluster.
. Select *Verify copy* if you want to verify data migrated with *Filesystem copy*. Data is verified by generating a checksum for each source file and checking the checksum after restoration. This option significantly reduces performance.
. Select a *Target storage class* for each PV.
+
You can change the storage class of data migrated with *Filesystem copy*.
. Click *Next*.
. In the *Migration options* screen, the *Direct image migration* option is selected if you specified an exposed image registry route for the source cluster. The *Direct PV migration* option is selected if you are migrating data with  *Filesystem copy*.
+
The direct migration options copy images and files directly from the source cluster to the target cluster. This option is much faster than copying images and files from the source cluster to the replication repository and then from the replication repository to the target cluster.
. Click *Next*.
. In the *Hooks* screen, click *Add Hook* to add a hook to the migration plan.
. Enter the hook name.
. If your hook is an Ansible playbook, click *Browse* to upload the playbook and update the *Ansible runtime image* field if you are using a custom Ansible image.
. If your hook is not an Ansible playbook, click *Custom container image* and specify the image name and path.
. Click *Source cluster* or *Target cluster* on which the hook should run.
. Enter the *Service account name* and the *Service account namespace* of the cluster.
. Select the migration step when the hook should run:

* *PreBackup*: Before backup tasks are started on the source cluster
* *PostBackup*: After backup tasks are complete on the source cluster
* *PreRestore*: Before restore tasks are started on the target cluster
* *PostRestore*: After restore tasks are complete on the target cluster

. Click *Add Hook* and then click *Close*.
+
You can add up to four hooks to a single migration plan. Each hook runs during a different migration step.

. Click *Finish* and then click *Close*.
+
The migration plan is displayed in the *Migration plans* list.
