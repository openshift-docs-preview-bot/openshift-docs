= Reducing Cloud Credential Operator passthrough mode permissions after installation
When using the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) in passthrough mode, each component has the same permissions used by all other components. If you do not reduce the permissions after installing, all components have the broad permissions that are required to run the installer.

After installation, you can reduce the permissions on your credential to only those that are required to run the cluster, as defined by the `CredentialsRequest` CRs in the release image for the version of {product-title} that you are using.

To locate the `CredentialsRequest` CRs that are required for AWS, Azure, or GCP and learn how to change the permissions the CCO uses, see the _Manually creating IAM_ section of the installation content for AWS, Azure, or GCP.
