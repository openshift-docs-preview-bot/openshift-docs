= Upgrading the performance profile to use device interrupt processing

When you upgrade the Performance Addon Operator performance profile custom resource definition (CRD) from v1 or v1alpha1 to v2, `globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` is set to `true` on existing profiles.

[NOTE]
====
When `globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` is set to `true`, device interrupts are processed across all CPUs as long as they don't belong to a guaranteed pod.

== Supported API Versions

The Performance Addon Operator supports `v2`, `v1`, and `v1alpha1` for the performance profile `apiVersion` field. The v1 and v1alpha1 APIs are identical. The v2 API includes an optional boolean field `globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` with a default value of `false`.

=== Upgrading Performance Addon Operator API from v1alpha1 to v1

When upgrading Performance Addon Operator API version from v1alpha1 to v1, the v1alpha1 performance profiles are converted on-the-fly using a "None" Conversion strategy and served to the Performance Addon Operator with API version v1.

=== Upgrading Performance Addon Operator API from v1alpha1 or v1 to v2

When upgrading from an older Performance Addon Operator API version, the existing v1 and v1alpha1 performance profiles are converted using a conversion webhook that injects the `globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` field with a value of `true`.
