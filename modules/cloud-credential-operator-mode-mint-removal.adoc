= Cloud Credential Operator mint mode with removal or rotation of the admin-level credential
Mint mode with removal or rotation of the admin-level credential is supported for AWS in {product-title} version 4.4 and later and for GCP in {product-title} version 4.7 and later.
//docs are versioned, is there a reason to call out the version in which this feature is supported?

This Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) option requires the presence of the admin-level credential during installation, but the credential is not stored in the cluster permanently and does not need to be long-lived.

After installing {product-title} in mint mode, you can remove the admin-level credential Secret from the cluster. If you remove the Secret, the CCO uses a previously minted read-only credential that allows it to verify whether all `CredentialsRequest` CRs have their required permissions. Once removed, the associated credential can be destroyed on the underlying cloud if desired.

The admin-level credential is not required unless something that requires an admin-level credential needs to be changed, for instance during an upgrade. Prior to each upgrade, you must reinstate the credential Secret with the admin-level credential. If the credential is not present, the upgrade might be blocked.
