[id="osdk-project-scaffolding-layout_{context}"]
= Operator project scaffolding layout

The `operator-sdk` CLI generates a number of packages for each Operator project. The following sections describes a basic rundown of each generated file and directory.

[id="osdk-project-scaffolding-layout-go_{context}"]
== Go-based projects

Go-based Operator projects (the default type) generated using the `operator-sdk init` command contain the following files and directories:

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===

|File or directory |Purpose

|`main.go`
|The main program of the Operator. This instantiates a new manager which registers all custom resource defintitions (CRDs) under `apis/` and starts all controllers under `controllers/`.

|`apis/`
|The directory tree that defines the APIs of the CRDs. Users are expected to edit the `apis/<version>/<kind>_types.go` files to define the API for each resource type and import these packages in their controllers to watch for these resource types.

|`controllers/`
|The controller implementations. Users are expected to edit the `controller/<kind>_controller.go` files to define the reconcile logic of the controller for handling a resource type of the specified kind.

|`config/`
|Kubernetes manifests used to deploy your controller on a cluster, including CRDs, RBAC, and certificates.

|`Makefile`
|Targets used to build and deploy your controller.

|`Dockerfile`
|Instructions used by a container engine to build your Operator.

|`manifests/`
|Kubernetes manifests for registering CRDs, setting up RBAC, and deploying the Operator as a deployment.

[id="osdk-project-scaffolding-layout-helm_{context}"]
== Helm-based projects

Helm-based Operator projects generated using the `operator-sdk new --type helm` command contain the following directories and files:

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===

|File/folders |Purpose

|`deploy/`
|Contains various YAML manifests for registering CRDs, setting up RBAC, and deploying the Operator as a Deployment.

|`helm-charts/<kind>`
|Contains a Helm chart initialized using the equivalent of the `helm create` command.

|`build/`
|Contains the Dockerfile and build scripts used to build the Operator.

|`watches.yaml`
|Contains group/version/kind (GVK) and Helm chart location.
