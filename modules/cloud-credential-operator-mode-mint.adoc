= Cloud Credential Operator mint mode

Mint mode is supported for AWS, Azure, and GCP.

Mint mode is the default and recommended best practice setting for the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) to use. In this mode, the CCO uses the provided admin-level cloud credential to run the cluster.

If the credential is not removed after installation, it is stored and used by the CCO to process `CredentialsRequest` CRs for components in the cluster and create new credentials for each with only the specific permissions that are required. The continuous reconciliation of cloud credentials in mint mode allows actions that require additional credentials or permissions, such as upgrading, to proceed.

The requirement that mint mode stores the admin-level credential in the cluster `kube-system` namespace might not suit the security requirements of every organization.

When using the CCO in mint mode, ensure that the credential you provide meets the requirements of the cloud on which you are running or installing {product-title}. If the provided credentials are not sufficient for mint mode, the CCO cannot create an IAM user.
