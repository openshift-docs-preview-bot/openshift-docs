= How CSV generation works

The `manifests/` directory of an Operator project is the standard location for all manifests required to deploy an Operator on OLM. The CSV generator, called by the `generate bundle` subcommand, requires certain input manifests to construct a CSV manifest; all inputs are read when the command is invoked, along with a CSV base, to idempotently regenerate a CSV.

The following resource kinds are typically included in a CSV:

* `Role`: Define Operator permissions within a namespace.
* `ClusterRole`: Define cluster-wide Operator permissions.
* `Deployment`: Define how an Operator operand is run in pods.
* `CustomResourceDefinition`: Definitions of custom objects your Operator reconciles.
* Custom resource examples: Examples of objects adhering to the spec of a particular CRD.

The CSV version is the same as the Operator version, and a new CSV is generated when upgrading Operator versions.

////
Operator authors may have different versioning requirements for these files and can configure which specific files are included in the `deploy/olm-catalog/csv-config.yaml` file.

== Workflow

Depending on whether an existing CSV is detected, and assuming all configuration defaults are used, the `generate bundle` subcommand either:

- Creates a new CSV, with the same location and naming convention as exists currently, using available data in YAML manifests and source files.

.. The update mechanism checks for an existing CSV in `deploy/`. When one is not found, it creates a `ClusterServiceVersion` object, referred to here as a _cache_, and populates fields easily derived from Operator metadata, such as Kubernetes API `ObjectMeta`.

.. The update mechanism searches `deploy/` for manifests that contain data a CSV uses, such as a `Deployment` resource, and sets the appropriate CSV fields in the cache with this data.

.. After the search completes, every cache field populated is written back to a CSV YAML file.

or:

- Updates an existing CSV at the currently pre-defined location, using available data in YAML manifests and source files.

.. The update mechanism checks for an existing CSV in `deploy/`. When one is found, the CSV YAML file contents are marshaled into a CSV cache.

.. The update mechanism searches `deploy/` for manifests that contain data a CSV uses, such as a `Deployment` resource, and sets the appropriate CSV fields in the cache with this data.

.. After the search completes, every cache field populated is written back to a CSV YAML file.

[NOTE]
====
Individual YAML fields are overwritten and not the entire file, as descriptions and other non-generated parts of a CSV should be preserved.
